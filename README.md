The plugin is created by [Andrey Cherkasov](jqy@protonmail.com) and sponsored by JetBrains s.r.o.

The plugin is based on [FindBugs-IDEA](https://github.com/andrepdo/findbugs-idea), which is created by [Andre Pfeiler](mailto:andrepdo@dev.java.net) and licensed under the [GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html).
